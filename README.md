# Solid-Tank-Simulation

## **Project Summary**
This MATLAB project focuses on optimizing the geometry of a refractive index bath container (solid tank) used in optical simulations. The goal is to evaluate and improve key metrics:
- **Beam Uniformity**
- **Magnification**
- **Effective Radius**

The code simulates ray paths through the container, visualizes results, and calculates these metrics to assess the system's performance.

## **Function Overview**
The main function, `STD_obj`, calculates and visualizes the characteristics of the refractive index bath container.

### **Function Details**
``matlab
Function: [score1, score2, score3] = STD_obj(x)
Inputs:
  x - Design parameters to be optimized for the refractive index bath container
      x(1): L - Total length of acrylic block
      x(2): h - Height of the bore center
      x(3): dlaser - Distance from the laser source to the acrylic block
      x(4): bEll - Semi-major axis length of the front ellipse
      x(5): ecc - Eccentricity of the front ellipse
      x(6): bEll2 - Semi-major axis length of the rear wall ellipse
      x(7): ecc2 - Eccentricity of the rear wall ellipse
      x(8): d3 - Distance from the back ellipse to the detectors
Outputs:
  score1 - Beam uniformity score
  score2 - Magnification score
  score3 - Effective radius score
