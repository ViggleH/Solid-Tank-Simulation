# Solid-Tank-Simulation

## **Project Summary**
This MATLAB project focuses on optimizing the geometry of a refractive index bath container (solid tank) used in optical simulations. The goal is to evaluate and improve key metrics:
- **Beam Uniformity**
- **Magnification**
- **Effective Radius**

The code simulates ray paths through the container, visualizes results, and calculates these metrics to assess the system's performance.
