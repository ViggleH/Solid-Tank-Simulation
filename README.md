# **Refractive Index Bath Container Optimization**

## **Project Description**
This MATLAB project simulates and evaluates the geometry of a refractive index bath container (solid tank) used in optical systems. It calculates four key performance metrics to optimize the container's design:
- **Beam Uniformity**: Measures the evenness of light distribution across the detectors.
- **Magnification**: Quantifies the spread of the beam over the detector array.
- **Effective Radius**: Determines the beam radius at critical points.
- **Crossing Count**: Counts ray intersections that may introduce image artifacts.

The project uses ray tracing to simulate laser paths, visualize their interactions with the container geometry, and evaluate system performance.

## **Function Overview**
### `STD_obj` Function
This function calculates and visualizes the characteristics of the refractive index bath container.

#### **Inputs**
The input `x` contains the following design parameters:
- `x(1)`: `L` - Total length of the acrylic block.
- `x(2)`: `h` - Height of the bore center.
- `x(3)`: `dlaser` - Distance from the laser source to the acrylic block.
- `x(4)`: `bEll` - Semi-major axis length of the front ellipse.
- `x(5)`: `ecc` - Eccentricity of the front ellipse.
- `x(6)`: `bEll2` - Semi-major axis length of the rear wall ellipse.
- `x(7)`: `ecc2` - Eccentricity of the rear wall ellipse.
- `x(8)`: `d3` - Distance from the back ellipse to the detectors.

#### **Outputs**
- `score1`: Beam uniformity score.
- `score2`: Magnification score.
- `score3`: Effective radius score.

## **Development History**
The original version of this code was developed by **Andy Ogilvy**. It has since been extensively refactored and enhanced by **Zhongda Huang** with the help of generative AI tools. Key improvements include:
- Modularization of code for better readability and maintenance.
- Enhanced visualization with detailed ray paths, container geometry, and detector setup.
- Streamlined computation of performance metrics.
